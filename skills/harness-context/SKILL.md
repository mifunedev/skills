# Harness Context

Use this skill when the user asks about Open Harness layout, lifecycle,
conventions, git workflow, or where files live.

## Steps

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` for the orchestrator contract — what the root-level
   agent does and does not do.
2. For layout questions, read the per-directory `README.md` files (e.g.
   `apps/README.md`, `crons/README.md`, `tasks/README.md`,
   `scripts/README.md`, `.worktrees/README.md`) and the `Project
   Structure` section of `CLAUDE.md`. There is no single comprehensive
   tree — use the filesystem and the directory READMEs.
3. Read relevant rules under `.claude/rules/`:
   - `git.md` — issue / branch / commit / PR conventions
   - `sandbox-processes.md` — tmux sessions for long-running processes
   - `directory-readme.md` — when a directory needs a README
   - `advisor-model.md` — pattern for delegating to sub-agents
4. Answer with `path:line` citations.

## Output shape

- Short factual answer first, then file references.
- Lifecycle questions (setup / validate / teardown): cite the relevant
  section of `CLAUDE.md`.
- Convention questions: cite the specific rule file under
  `.claude/rules/`.
