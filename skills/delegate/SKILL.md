  TRIGGER when: asked to "delegate this", "run this plan", "execute the stories",
  or "parallelize" the work. Writing or reading a plan is not a trigger and
  authorizes no dispatch. Runs the stories in the prd.json task tracker as
  bounded workers in dependency waves. The active session verifies each result,
  accepts it, and records it in prd.json.

# Delegate

## The advisor/worker pattern

The **advisor** is the active session. It decides, assigns bounded stories,
verifies each result, and accepts it. The advisor alone writes `prd.json`:
`passes`, `commit`, and `notes`.

A **worker** is a bounded execution context, not a project role. A worker
implements one assignment inside its owned paths. It reports each criterion as
executed or reasoned. A worker never accepts its own result.

Use a worker when the story is self-contained and gains from parallelism,
isolated context, or restricted tools. Keep the work in the active session when
phases share substantial context or need iterative refinement.

| Assign to a worker | Keep in the active session |
|---|---|
| Tracked implementation edits: code, tests, docs, repair | Goal interpretation, decomposition, verification, acceptance |
| Coupled implementation, in one continuing worker | Reconciliation of results that share substantial context |
| Verbose disposable output: logs, search dumps, test runs | Iterative refinement against operator feedback |
| Disjoint owned paths with no shared mutable state | `prd.json`, `prd.md`, and the PR body |

## Input

Resolve the input from the arguments:

1. `<task-slug>`: read `<tasks-dir>/<slug>/prd.json`. `<tasks-dir>` is the
   directory where the host keeps task folders. Use the directory that the host
   configures. An AGRO harness uses the `tasks` folder of its control plane.
2. `--plan <path>`: read the `prd.json` at `<path>`.
3. A free-text plan with no `prd.json`: run `/prd` first to make the tracker.
   To skip the tracker, dispatch once with no saved state. Tell the operator
   which path you took.
4. No input: print the usage line from `argument-hint`, then stop.

Each story in `userStories` is one task:

- `priority` sets the order. A lower number runs first.
- `dependsOn` is optional. It lists the story IDs that must pass first.
- `acceptanceCriteria` are the checks that the advisor runs.
- `files` are the owned write paths of the worker.

The advisor skips each story with `passes: true`.

## Dispatch record

Write one record for each story before dispatch. Keep only these fields:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Story ID | The `id` from `prd.json` |
| Dependencies | The `dependsOn` IDs, or none |
| Read scope | The files and directories that the worker reads |
| Owned write paths | The `files` of the story; the worker edits nothing else |
| Deliverable | One commit on the worker branch |
| Verification | The commands and checks from `acceptanceCriteria`, with expected results |
| Execution directory | The absolute path of the worktree |
| Model and reason | The requested model, or the provider default, and the reason |

## Waves

1. Put each story in a wave. A story is ready when every `dependsOn` story has
   `passes: true`.
2. Run the ready stories of a wave in parallel, at most 5 workers per wave.
3. Give each parallel writer an isolated worktree. Branch it from the task branch.
4. Stories with overlapping `files` run in sequence.
5. Workers stay flat. Workers never spawn workers.

A single story can use one worker. Parallelism is not mandatory.

## Worker brief

Give each worker the dispatch record, the exclusions, and these rules:

- Edit only the owned write paths. Obey the exclusions.
- Work only in the execution directory.
- Report each criterion as one of these:
  - **executed**: the command and exit status.
  - **reasoned**: a one-line argument.
- Commit on the worker branch. Never push.
- Never write `prd.json`.
- Use no bare `git stash` or `git stash pop`. The stash stack is shared with
  other sessions.
- Never bypass a hook. A rerun of a blocked command through a script file, a
  heredoc, or another tool is a bypass. Report a blocked action as `BLOCKED`.

## Acceptance

A worker report is not acceptance. For each story, the advisor does these steps:

1. Inspect the worker commit.
2. Bring the commit onto the task branch.
3. Rerun the verification on the integrated task branch.
4. Write `passes: true`, `commit`, and `notes` in `prd.json`. In `notes`,
   mark each criterion executed or reasoned.

If a check fails, the story returns to the same worker with a bounded repair.
The advisor does not repair. Dependents of a failed story wait.

## Integration

After acceptance, do these steps on the task branch:

1. Commit `prd.json` with the accepted story. Do not push it. The git workflow of the
   repository names the pushes for a draft task PR.
2. Tick the story in the PR `## Stories` checklist.
3. Remove the worker worktree and branch. Use the git maintenance command that
   the git workflow of the repository names.

## Resume

There is no separate ledger. `prd.json` holds the state.

1. Read `prd.json`.
2. Take the next story with `passes: false` whose dependencies passed.
3. Re-verify the stories it builds on.
4. Continue from **Waves**.

## Model policy

- Follow explicit operator selections and exclusions of models.
- Otherwise, choose a model for each story. Record the reason in the dispatch
  record.
- Never substitute a model silently.
- A required control that is unavailable blocks the story. Ask the operator.

Provider defaults live in provider settings. For Claude Code, the default is
`CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` in the `env` object of `.claude/settings.json`.
A per-dispatch model overrides the default.

## Close

When every story has `passes: true`, do these steps:

1. Validate the integrated result with the checks of the repository: lint,
   typecheck, test, and build. Record each exit status.
2. Write `## Lessons` at the end of `prd.md`. Give each lesson a claim,
   evidence, and exactly one outcome:
   - fixed in this PR;
   - issue #N; or
   - dropped, with the reason.

   Fold a finding into the PR only when one of these conditions is true:
   its fix is in a file that the PR already changes and the PR caused or
   exposed the finding, or the finding breaks the chain in use. For each
   other defect, propose one issue for each defect surface. If an open issue
   already covers the surface, propose a comment on that issue. Drop
   judgment and process observations, and findings that a test already
   catches. List the proposed issues in the final report. Before the
   operator approves the proposed issues at Close, create no issue.

   "None" is a valid body.
3. Fill the PR evidence sections from the `notes` in `prd.json`.
4. Fill the PR `## Manual review` section from the evidence of the last story.
   Use the manual-review shape that the git workflow of the repository defines.
   Write only the expected results that the evidence observed.
5. Continue with the "Ready for review" step of the git workflow of the repository.

## Dry run

With `--dry-run`, print the waves and the dispatch records. Write nothing.
The dry run dispatches nothing.
